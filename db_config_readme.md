# PostgreSQL Reconfiguration and Current State

## Overview

This document provides a detailed account of the recent reconfiguration of the PostgreSQL server, including changes made to the network setup, port configurations, and connectivity with other services like FastAPI and `n8n`. This guide is intended for future administrators to understand the current setup and make any necessary adjustments.

## Reconfiguration Steps

### 1. Docker Network Setup

- **Private Network**: The PostgreSQL container (`my_postgres`) is connected to a private Docker network named `n8n-postgres-net`. This network facilitates communication between `n8n` and PostgreSQL.
- **Bridge Network**: The container is also connected to the default `bridge` network, allowing access from the host machine.

### 2. Port Configuration

- **Internal Port**: PostgreSQL listens on the default internal port `5432`.
- **Host Port Mapping**: The container maps the internal port `5432` to port `5435` on the host. This means external applications must connect to port `5435` to access the database.

### 3. Configuration Files

#### `postgresql.conf`

- **Listen Addresses**: Configured to listen on all interfaces.
  ```plaintext
  listen_addresses = '*'
  ```
- **Port**: Set to the default PostgreSQL port.
  ```plaintext
  port = 5432
  ```

#### `pg_hba.conf`

- **Access Control**: Configured to allow connections from the Docker network and the host.
  ```plaintext
  host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0            md5
  host    all             all             172.22.0.0/16        md5
  ```

### 4. FastAPI Configuration

- **Database URL**: Updated to reflect the host port mapping.
  ```python
  DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://admin_user:your_password@localhost:5435/omi_data"
  ```

### 5. Verification

- **Connectivity**: Verified using `psql` to ensure the database is accessible on port `5435`.
- **Service Logs**: Checked logs for both PostgreSQL and FastAPI to confirm successful connections.

## Current State

- **PostgreSQL Container**: Running on Docker, accessible via port `5435` on the host.
- **`n8n` Integration**: Successfully connected to PostgreSQL via the `n8n-postgres-net` network.
- **FastAPI Integration**: Successfully connected to PostgreSQL using the updated port configuration.

## Future Considerations

- **Security**: Regularly review `pg_hba.conf` and firewall settings to ensure secure access.
- **Backup**: Ensure regular backups are configured using the `admin_user` for comprehensive coverage.
- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for database performance and connectivity issues.
